# FlashReflex

FlashReflex is a reaction game that tests if you can react faster than Base can produce a flashblock with a transaction preconfirmation!

Built for [the builder sidequest](https://x.com/neodaoist/status/1895229868532457898)

Try it out at [flashreflex.vercel.app](https://flashreflex.vercel.app)

## How it works

The game is simple. First, you do a transaction, then you play a mini
reaction game.

For the reaction game, there are a few random Base logos on your screen.
As soon as you broadcast your transaction, you need to click the one
that turns into the Flashbots logo as quick as you can.

If you react before a preconfirmation comes through, you 100% win the
game!

If you react after a preconfirmation comes through, but before a regular
preconfirmation, not bad - but you can do better.

If you react after both types of confirmations come through, TOO SLOW!
